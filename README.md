# Implementation for Bachelorthesis
A tool to visualize cluster of companies and process analyses.

The current state is not recommended to be integrated into other systems. Needs a lot of refactoring due to the short time of Implementation.

To start it:
1. npm install
2. bower install
3. sudo node scriptsBA/clusterCompanies.js
4. sudo node app

Go to localhost in your browser. Wait until clusters are displayed. Adjustments to the used Algorithm and, if hierarchical the used partition, can only be made in code.
After clusters are displayed click on apply. After some red borders appeared at some circles you can click on the circles and have a look at the analyses.
